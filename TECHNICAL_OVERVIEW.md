   - Streaming audio support

2. **STT Engine** (`stt.py`)
   - Real-time speech transcription
   - 24 language support
   - Multiple audio format support (WAV, MP3, FLAC)
   - Configurable sample rates and bit rates

3. **Conversation Agent** (`conversation.py`)
   - Natural language conversation with Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - Context-aware responses
   - Integration with Home Assistant entities
   - Conversation history management

4. **Configuration System** (`config_flow.py`)

- **gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05**: Conversation agent

#### Voice Characteristics
| Voice Category | Examples | Best For |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| Bright | Zephyr, Autonoe | Announcements, alerts |
| Firm | Kore, Orus, Alnilam | Professional content, instructions |
| Upbeat | Puck, Laomedeia | Welcome messages, positive content |
| Smooth | Algieba, Despina | Narration, storytelling |
| Informative | Charon, Rasalgethi | News, weather, factual content |
| Breathy | Enceladus | Intimate messages, bedtime stories |

### Advanced Features

#### Style Enhancement Engine
The integration automatically enhances messages with natural language instructions:

```python
# Input: "Welcome home!"
# Style: cheerful, Emotion: happy
# Enhanced: "Say cheerfully with happiness: Welcome home!"
```

#### Multi-Speaker Orchestration
Supports complex dialogue scenarios:
- Automatic speaker assignment
- Voice characteristic matching
- Conversation flow management

#### Context-Aware Conversations
The conversation agent maintains context and can:
- Reference previous exchanges
- Integrate with Home Assistant state
- Provide device-specific responses
- Handle multi-turn conversations

## Technical Specifications

### Audio Processing
- **Sample Rate**: 24kHz (configurable: 8kHz-48kHz)
- **Channels**: Mono/Stereo support
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit
- **Format**: WAV (primary), MP3, FLAC supported
- **Latency**: ~2-5 seconds for standard requests

### Performance Characteristics
- **Concurrent Requests**: Supports multiple simultaneous TTS calls
- **Memory Usage**: ~50-100MB baseline, scales with request volume
- **Cache Strategy**: No local caching (cloud-based processing)
- **Rate Limits**: Managed by Google AI API quotas

### Error Handling
- Graceful API failure recovery
- Automatic voice fallback
- Request timeout management
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- API keys encrypted in Home Assistant configuration
- No audio data stored locally
- All processing occurs in Google's cloud
- Conversation history kept in memory only

### Network Requirements
- HTTPS connection to Google AI services
- Outbound port 443 access required
- Minimum 1Mbps bandwidth recommended for streaming

## Installation Methods

### HACS Installation (Recommended)
1. Add custom repository to HACS
2. Install integration
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Configure via UI

### Manual Installation
1. Copy `custom_components/gemini_ai_tts/` to HA config
2. Install Python dependencies
3. Restart and configure

### Docker Considerations
- Ensure container has internet access
- Mount custom_components properly
- Consider resource limits for audio processing

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Setup
```yaml
# Minimal configuration
gemini_ai_tts:
  api_key: "your-api-key-here"
```

### Advanced Configuration
```yaml
# Full options configuration via UI:
# - Model: gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts
# - Voice: Puck (Upbeat)
# - Style: Natural
# - Emotion: Neutral
# - Pace: Normal
# - Language: Auto-detect
# - Streaming: Enabled
# - Multi-speaker: Enabled
```

## Service APIs

### Core Services
